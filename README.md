Week 1:

This week, I believe that I was able to get the basic foundation of this project done as far as my Week 1 goals are concerned. This week, I came up with my map and I have so far added data for two states and five metropolitan areas. The work I have done so far serves as a precursor to how the finished map will look like. I believe the bulk of my work will be done by the end of Week 2, by which time I plan to enter most or nearly all of the data sets into the map. I built this application based on what I learned during the last assignment (Assignment 12) by using Mapbox server tiles, the Leaflet JavaScript API, and jQuery. So far I’m pleased with my progress in that I have built a working prototype map that is presented in the way that I intended it to by this stage of the project.

Week 2:

This week, I was able to continue working on my map project. As of this writing, I’ve been able to add 12 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. I’ve also added all the corresponding metropolitan areas that are located in the aforementioned areas.  Although I have much left to do, I believe that I’ve been making good progress and I believe that I’ll have all the remaining U.S. states and metropolitan areas completed and presented on the map by the conclusion of Week 3.
