Week 1:

This week, I believe that I was able to get the basic foundation of this project done as far as my Week 1 goals are concerned. This week, I came up with my map and I have so far added data for two states and five metropolitan areas. The work I have done so far serves as a precursor to how the finished map will look like. I believe the bulk of my work will be done by the end of Week 2, by which time I plan to enter most or nearly all of the data sets into the map. I built this application based on what I learned during the last assignment (Assignment 12) by using Mapbox server tiles, the Leaflet JavaScript API, and jQuery. So far Iâ€™m pleased with my progress in that I have built a working prototype map that is presented in the way that I intended it to by this stage of the project.
